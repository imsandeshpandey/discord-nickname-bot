# Dicord Nickname Voting Bot
Created this bot to solve a small issue I faced on my server where I have few of my friends with the same role which makes it such that they can't change one another's nickname. So, this bot allows creating a poll for nickname change of anyone (except server owner) and if the poll results are in favor of nickname change then it will change the member's nickname or reject it if not.

## Setup
I'm using bun but you can use anything you want, but you might have to tweak scripts if you do since the build script is specific to bun.

To install:
```bash
bun install
```

To run:
```bash
bun run dev
```

To build:
```bash
bun run build
```
